# resampling in imbalanced datasets


Under sampling
* random
* tomek links:
  Tomek links are pairs of very close instances but of opposite classes. Removing instances of the majority class of each pair increases
  the space between the two classes thus facilititating the classification process.

* Cluster Centroids
  this technique performs under sampling by generating centroids based on clustering methods. The data will be previously grouped by
  similarity, in order to preserve information.

Over sampling
* random 
* SMOTE
  Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique consists of synthesizing elements fir the minority class, based on those that already exist.
  It works on randomly picking a point from the minority class and computing the K nearest neighbours for this point. The synthetic
  points are added between the chosen point and its neighbours.
