Types:
  1. heterogeneous ensembles
    different component models built independently and then results are merged in a way or the other
  2. homogeneous ensembles
    examples: Adaboost, XGboost, random forests
    same algorithms differnt variants using same algorithm
    sometimes built iteratively
  3. metamodelling
    different models working together
    could be different model for different cases
